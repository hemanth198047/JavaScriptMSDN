This chapter introduces javascript and discusses some of its fundamental concepts.

What you should already know

1. Basic understanding of internet and world wide web
2. Good working knowledge of HTML
3. Some programming experience.

Where to find javascript information

The Javascript documentation on MDN includes the following

1. Synamic scripting with javascript: provides structured java script guides for beginners and introduces basic concepts of programming and the internet.
2. JavaScript Guide: provides an overview about javascript language and its objects.
3. JavaScript Reference: Provides detailed reference material for javascript

What is JavaScript
==================
Javascript is a cross platform object oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive. There are also more advanced versions of javascript such as Node.js which allows you to
add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (ex: browser) javascript can be connected to objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

Javascript contains a standard set of control objects such as Array, Map and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures and statements. core javascript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example

1. Client-Side Javascript extends the core javascript by suplying objects to control the browser and it's Document Object Model (DOM). for example, client side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
2. Server Side javascript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running javascript on server. For example, server side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on the server.

This means that in the browser, javascript can change how the web page looks, and likewise Node.js javascript on the server can respond to custom requests sent by code executed in the browser.

JavaScript and Java
===================
Javascript and java are similar in some ways and are different in many ways. Javascript resembles java but is not strongly typed and don't have static typing. Javascript follows most java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control flow constructs which is why it was renamed from Livescript to Javascript. In contrast to java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, javascript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, boolean and string values. javascript has a prototype based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. the prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritence; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. javascript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. functions can be properties for objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

Javascript is a very free form language compared to java. you do not have to declare all variables, classes and methods. You do not have to be concerned about whether methods are public, private or protected and you do not have to implement interfaces. variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

Java is a class oriented programming language designed for faster execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the byte code. Java's class based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritence and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. there requirements make java programming more complex than javascript programming

In contrast, javascript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamicallytyped languages such as HyperTalk and dBase. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built in funcitionality and minimal requirements for object creation.

JavaScript and ECMAScript Specification
=======================================
Javascript is standardized at ECMA International - The European association for standardizing information and communication systems to deliver a standardized international programming language based on javascript. This standardized version of ECMAScript also called as javascript behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of javascript. The DOM defines the way how HTML Document objects are exposed to your script. 

getting Started with JavaScript
===============================
To get started with Javascript, all you need is a modern web browser like chrome, mozilla firefox, safari etc. A very useful tool in exploring javascript is the console in a browser. This is a tool which enables you to enter the javascript and run it in the current page.
